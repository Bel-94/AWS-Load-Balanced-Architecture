# AWS Application Load Balancer Demo (Blue/Red Deployment)

This project demonstrates how to set up an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** on AWS to distribute traffic between two EC2 instances (Blue & Red servers).  
It also includes optional **Route 53 hosted routing**, where you can configure a fake domain for demo purposes or use a real domain if you own one.  

---

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
- An **AWS Account** (Free Tier is enough).
- **IAM user** with administrator or EC2/ALB privileges.
- Basic knowledge of launching an **EC2 instance**.

---

## Architecture
The setup includes:
- **2 EC2 Instances**: Blue server & Red server.
- **Target Groups**: One for each server.
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic.
- **Route 53 Hosted Zone** (optional): For domain-based routing.

### 1. Create the S3 Bucket
1. Go to **AWS Console â†’ S3 â†’ Create bucket**.  
2. Enter a **globally unique name**: e.g. `arr-bucket-123456`.  
3. Region: **us-east-1 (N. Virginia)** to match the lab setup.  
4. Keep **Block Public Access = ON** (recommended).  
   - EC2 will use an IAM role to fetch files (not public objects).  
5. Click **Create bucket**.
