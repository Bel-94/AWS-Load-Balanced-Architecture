# AWS Application Load Balancer Demo (Blue/Red Deployment)

This project demonstrates how to set up an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** on AWS to distribute traffic between two EC2 instances (Blue & Red servers).  
It also includes optional **Route 53 hosted routing**, where you can configure a fake domain for demo purposes or use a real domain if you own one.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
- An **AWS Account** (Free Tier is enough).
- **IAM user** with administrator or EC2/ALB privileges.
- Basic knowledge of launching an **EC2 instance**.
